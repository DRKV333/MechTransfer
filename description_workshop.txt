MechTransfer is a small mod, that adds various wire controlled devices to interact with items and move them between containers.

The mod contains the following features:
[list]
    [*]Transferring items from one chest to another
    [*]Dropping and picking up items
    [*]Item sorting and detection
    [*]Automatic crafting
[/list]

Below is a list of the added items and their functions.

​
Standard chests from any other mod should also work out of the box. If your mod has a custom item storage solution, you can use MechTransfer's Mod.Call() based API to set up an adapter for it. (More information available [url=https://github.com/DRKV333/MechTransfer/wiki/Adapter-extensibility]here[/url].)

Support for Magic Storage is built into MechTransfer. (see Magic Storage Interface)​

[h1]Transfer Relay [img]https://i.imgur.com/s1eAve4.png[/img][/h1]
(1x Pneumatic Actuator + 1x Any Pressure Plate @ Workbench)

The back of the arrow acts as a receiver, the front acts as a sender. It receives items, and sends them out again.
Outputs a wire signal when an item passes through it.

The sending device will always connect to the first receiver in line. It will also skip any injectors, that can't inject due to lack of chest space.

You can use relays to reroute items to a longer path.

Every relay will only receive once per transfer. This prevent things like this, from crashing the game.
