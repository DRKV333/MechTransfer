# Cross Mod Support

MechTransfer supports all standard chests from any mod. If your mod has a custom item storage solution, you can use MechTransfer's Mod.Call() based API to set up an adapter for it.
The complete API documentation is available [here](https://github.com/DRKV333/MechTransfer/wiki/Adapter-extensibility).
